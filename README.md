# FridgeEase - Nike Spengler

This project started as a group project where we came up with the idea together. Then we had all group members build our own version of the idea. 

## Built using: 
React, CSS, SASS, Redux, Firebase


## About the project

FridgeEase is an app built with a backend consisting of Firebase and Redux and a frontend in React. The idea is to be able to register your refrigerator and then search for recipes for the items that need to be used first.

You can also create a shopping list by adding items to it from your fridge. Currently, you as a user can register, log in and add items to your fridge, view detailed information about the item through the "info" icon, add the items you want to your shopping list by pressing the "check" icon and delete the items you want to remove from your fridge through the "trash" icon.

In the shopping list, just like in the refrigerator, you can read detailed information about the item through the icon with the same appearance as in the refrigerator, also the icon to delete a similar item. You can also increase and decrease the number of items of the same product using the plus and minus icons. Under the shopping list, you can see how many items you have in total in your shopping list and you can also delete the entire contents of the list by pressing the "Delete shopping list" button.

In terms of appearance, I have departed from our initial design and am inspired by Coop's design and envision this app as an addition to Coop's already existing app. It was also something that came out in the user tests, that our original design was too plotty, so I've scaled back as much as I could.

What would need to be further developed to reach the full functionality of the app is to add a recipe database, where one can match recipes with items from the fridge. As well as being able to save on their favorite recipes. Something I would also like to build on to achieve better functionality is the admin functionality.

To run the app, type “npm start” in your console. To be able to use Firebase functionality, you must first register and then log in.
